## Wine Dataset Analysis

This project involves analyzing a wine dataset using Python and pandas. The dataset contains information about various wines, including their country of origin, description, points, price, region, variety, and winery.

### Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing step, the following tasks were performed:

1. Loading the dataset: The wine dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Handling missing values: Any missing values in the dataset were handled appropriately.
3. Data cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by removing any irrelevant columns.
4. Splitting the dataset: The dataset was split into input features (x) and the target variable (y).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the dataset was preprocessed, exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data. The following tasks were carried out:

5. Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles, were computed for the dataset.
6. Data visualization: Various visualizations, including histograms, were plotted to visualize the distribution of different variables.

### Saving the Modified Dataset

After completing the analysis, the modified DataFrame was saved to a CSV file for future use. The file was saved without the index to maintain consistency.
